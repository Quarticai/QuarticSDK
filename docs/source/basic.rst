Basic Functionality
===================

This article explains the various classes of Quartic SDK along with their methods and
available attributes.

APIClient
------------

Class refers to the API client which is used as the interface between
the user querying the Quartic AI Platform and their use case.


The available methods are as follows:

init
~~~~

This class has the following parameters for initialization:

-  **host (mandatory)**: Refers to the host the user connects to for
   making API calls.
-  **username (optional)**: Required for Basic Authentication.
-  **password (optional)**: Required for Basic Authentication.
-  **oauth\_token (optional)**: Required for OAuth2.0 Authentication.

The class provides two methods of authentication: BasicAuthentication and OAuth2.0.

BasicAuthentication:
********************

The user must pass the username and password along with the hostname in the APIClient
to ensure all the successive API calls are authenticated via Basic Authentication

::

    client = APIClient(host="http://test.quartic.ai", username="username", password="password")

OAuth2.0
********

The user must pass the OAuth token along with the hostname to ensure that all the
successive API calls are authenticated via OAuth2.0. For the detailed information on fetching
tokens, please refer to the Global Settings article in the Quartic Knowledge Base.

::

    client = APIClient(host="http://test.quartic.ai", oauth_token="9865c994212e495690c2db3fc6cbdfea")
