Quartic SDK documentation
=========================

Quartic SDK is Quartic.ai's external software development kit which
allows users to use assets, tags, and other intelligence outside the
Quartic AI Platform. Using the Quartic SDK, third party developers who
have access to the Quartic AI Platform can build custom applications.
Quartic SDK supports both BasicAuthentication and OAuth2.0 Authentication,
where users provide their username and password in the former or
the OAuth token in the later.
